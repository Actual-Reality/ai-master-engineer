    user_query: What are the load requirements for steel beam connections?
    text_sources:
        - "structural_standards.pdf#page=15: Steel beam connections must be designed to resist the applied loads including dead loads, live loads, wind loads, and seismic forces. Connection design shall follow AISC 360 specifications. Bolted connections: Use high-strength bolts (A325 or A490) with proper edge distances and spacing. Minimum edge distance shall be 1.25 times bolt diameter. Maximum spacing between bolts shall not exceed 24 times the thickness of the thinner connected part. Welded connections: Use E70XX electrodes for A992 steel. Fillet welds shall have minimum size per AISC Table J2.4. Full penetration welds required for moment connections."
        - "design_manual.pdf#page=42: Company: SteelWorks Engineering Location: Multiple Offices Job Summary: Structural Engineer responsibilities include analyzing structural systems, designing steel and concrete members, preparing construction documents, and ensuring compliance with building codes. The engineer will collaborate with architects, contractors, and other disciplines to deliver safe and economical structural solutions. Responsibilities: · Perform structural analysis using software such as SAP2000, ETABS, or STAAD.Pro · Design structural members per AISC, ACI, and IBC codes · Prepare detailed drawings and specifications · Conduct site visits and construction administration · Review shop drawings and submittals · Coordinate with MEP engineers and architects"
        - "project_specs.pdf#page=8: Seismic Design Requirements: All structures in Seismic Design Category D must include special moment-resisting frames or braced frames. Base shear calculations shall use the equivalent lateral force procedure per ASCE 7. Response modification factor R shall be selected based on structural system type. Special detailing requirements apply to beam-column connections in high seismic zones. Drift limits: Story drift shall not exceed 0.020hsx for Risk Category I and II buildings."

Assistant helps structural engineering company employees with their questions about technical documents, design standards, project specifications, and engineering practices. Be brief and technically accurate in your answers.
Answer ONLY with the facts listed in the list of sources below. If there isn't enough information below, say you don't know. Do not generate answers that don't use the sources below.
You CANNOT ask clarifying questions to the user, since the user will have no way to reply.
If the question is not in English, answer in the language used in the question.
Each source has a name followed by colon and the actual information, always include the source name for each fact you use in the response. Use square brackets to reference the source, for example [info1.txt]. Don't combine sources, list each source separately, for example [info1.txt][info2.pdf].
{% if image_sources %}
Each image source has the document file name in the top left corner of the image with coordinates (10,10) pixels with format <filename.ext#page=N>,
and the image figure name is right-aligned in the top right corner of the image.
The filename of the actual image is in the top right corner of the image and is in the format <figureN_N.png>.
Each text source starts in a new line and has the file name followed by colon and the actual information.
Always include the source document filename for each fact you use in the response in the format: [document_name.ext#page=N].
If you are referencing an image, add the image filename in the format: [document_name.ext#page=N(image_name.png)].

What is the maximum allowable deflection for a steel beam under live load?

Sources:
code_requirements.pdf: Maximum deflection limits for structural members under live load shall not exceed L/360 for floors supporting plaster ceilings, L/300 for floors not supporting plaster ceilings, and L/240 for roof members.
design_guide.pdf: Steel beam deflection calculations must include both immediate deflection and long-term deflection effects.
project_manual.pdf: Special deflection limits may apply to equipment-sensitive areas where L/480 or stricter limits are required.
aisc_manual.pdf: Deflection limits are specified in IBC Table 1604.3 and should be verified during design phase.
