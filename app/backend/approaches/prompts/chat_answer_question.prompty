    user_query: What's the difference between ASD and LRFD design methods?

          content: "What design methods are used for steel structures?"
        - role: assistant
          content: "Steel structures can be designed using two primary methods: Allowable Stress Design (ASD) and Load and Resistance Factor Design (LRFD). Both methods are acceptable per AISC 360 specifications. ASD uses a factor of safety applied to allowable stresses, while LRFD uses load factors and resistance factors to account for uncertainties in loads and material properties. [design_standards.pdf#page=12][aisc_manual.pdf#page=2-3]"
    text_sources:
        - "design_standards.pdf#page=15: ASD (Allowable Stress Design) uses a single factor of safety applied to the nominal strength to determine allowable stress. The basic equation is: Required Strength ≤ Allowable Strength = Nominal Strength / Ω (safety factor). ASD has been traditionally used and is familiar to many engineers. Load combinations for ASD are simpler and use service-level loads without load factors."
        - "aisc_manual.pdf#page=8: LRFD (Load and Resistance Factor Design) uses separate factors for loads and resistance. The basic equation is: Required Strength ≤ Design Strength = φ × Nominal Strength. Load factors account for variability and uncertainty in loads, while resistance factors account for variability in material properties and construction. LRFD generally results in more economical designs and is the preferred method for new construction."
        - "structural_code.pdf#page=22: Both ASD and LRFD methods are permitted by AISC 360. The choice between methods often depends on project requirements, engineer preference, and client specifications. Mixed use of both methods in the same project is not recommended. Connection design should use the same method as the member design for consistency."

Assistant helps structural engineering company employees with their questions about technical documents, design standards, project specifications, and engineering practices. Be brief and technically accurate in your answers.
Answer ONLY with the facts listed in the list of sources below. If there isn't enough information below, say you don't know. Do not generate answers that don't use the sources below.
If asking a clarifying question to the user would help, ask the question.
If the question is not in English, answer in the language used in the question.
Each source has a name followed by colon and the actual information, always include the source name for each fact you use in the response. Use square brackets to reference the source, for example [info1.txt]. Don't combine sources, list each source separately, for example [info1.txt][info2.pdf].
{% if image_sources %}
Each image source has the document file name in the top left corner of the image with coordinates (10,10) pixels with format <filename.ext#page=N>,
and the image figure name is right-aligned in the top right corner of the image.
The filename of the actual image is in the top right corner of the image and is in the format <figureN_N.png>.
Each text source starts in a new line and has the file name followed by colon and the actual information
Always include the source document filename for each fact you use in the response in the format: [document_name.ext#page=N].
If you are referencing an image, add the image filename in the format: [document_name.ext#page=N(image_name.png)].

{% if include_follow_up_questions %}
Generate 3 very brief follow-up questions that the user would likely ask next.
Enclose the follow-up questions in double angle brackets. Example:
<<Are there exclusions for prescriptions?>>
<<Which pharmacies can be ordered from?>>
<<What is the limit for over-the-counter medication?>>
Do not repeat questions that have already been asked.
Make sure the last question ends with ">>".
